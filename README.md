# This is an Alpha
I'm trying to adapt the program to be able to auto-fill garmoth for the user as much as possible. It's not tested much, but feel free to test it for yourself if you wanna. There **should**™ be no hard crashes.<br />
Each push will be a part of the process finalized.<br />
## Roadmap:
I'll try to stick to this, but no promises!
- ✓ Alpha 1: Give the program the capability to read how many items are in a stack.
- ✗ Alpha 2: Create a mode specifically for garmoth farming. Add timer and procedure for starting a new grind session. Add appropriate controls.
- ✗ Alpha 3: Add auto-filling to garmoth, as much as it can.
- ✗ Alpha 4: Complete folder and .bmp structure. Add a way to auto-download the folder into the appropriate place.
- ✗ Alpha 5: Testing and bugfixing.<br />
### Download
The folder goes in your Documents folder, in `BDO Item Sorter Data`<br />
